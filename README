CSS is beautiful on its own 🌈 but sometimes needs some help 
Typescript is a beautiful(and powerful) language 😁
Vue is pleasurable to work with 🙌
RxJS makes data seem like play-dough 😊
Angular helps manage all the compexity I have in my applications with ease 👷‍♀️
And NestJS makes me know what I'm doing, farewell the server.ts monstrosity! 👋
Good ol' chrome will always have my back 🥹

Tools I'm currently learning:
Flutter 🤯 and Dart 🎯 so that I can be the one-man-army 😎.
